Manual test for Issue 543, Account Expiration Support

1.  Unzip and start OpenDS.

2.  Add some entries (shared/data/security/manual_tests/security_startup.ldif).

Note there is a user, uid=auser,ou=People,o=Security Tests,dc=example,dc=com
which will search the entry, uid=scarter, ou=People, o=Security Tests, dc=example,dc=com.

3.  The user, uid=auser, searches entry, uid=scarter. Successful.

bash-3.00# /tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapsearch -T -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "uid=auser,ou=People,o=Security Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w SecurityRules -b "uid=scarter,ou=People,o=Security Tests,dc=example,dc=com" "(objectclass=*)" uid
dn: uid=scarter,ou=People,o=Security Tests,dc=example,dc=com
uid: scarter

4.  Get the current date and time. On Solaris, use the command, "date". Modify the ldif file, shared/data/security/manual_tests/admin_account_expiration.ldif, for about 5 minutes ahead of the current time.

5.  Directory Manager adds the contents of shared/data/security/manual_tests/admin_account_expiration.ldif
to OpenDS. This makes the user account for uid=auser expire in about 5 minutes.

6.  Repeat step 3. Before the expiration time, the search should be successful. 

After the expiration time, the following error should be obtained......

bash-3.00# /tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapsearch -T -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "uid=auser,ou=People,o=Security Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w SecurityRules -b "uid=scarter,ou=People,o=Security Tests,dc=example,dc=com" "(objectclass=*)" uid
The simple bind attempt failed
Result Code:  49 (Invalid Credentials)

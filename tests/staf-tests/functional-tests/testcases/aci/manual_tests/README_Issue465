Manual test for Issue 465, Access Control "timeofday" Client Target

1.  Unzip and start OpenDS.

2.  Add some entries (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/aci_startup.ldif).

Note there is a user, uid=auser,ou=People,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
which will modify the entry, uid=scarter, ou=People, ou=aci branch, o=ACI Tests, dc=example,dc=com.

3.  The user, uid=auser, attempts to modify entry, uid=scarter (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/replace_l.ldif).

Error 50 (Insufficient Access Rights) results.

/tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapmodify -a -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "uid=auser,ou=People,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w ACIRules -f /tmp/manual_tests/replace_l.ldif 
Processing MODIFY request for uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation failed
Result Code:  50 (Insufficient Access Rights)
Additional Information:  The entry uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com cannot be modified due to insufficient access rights


4.  Add ACI with the timeofday set to whatever makes the current time valid. This example uses any time in the afternoon. (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/add_aci_right_time.ldif)

5.  Repeat step 3. Now it is successful.

/tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapmodify -a -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "uid=auser,ou=People,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w ACIRules -f /tmp/manual_tests/replace_l.ldif 
Processing MODIFY request for uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation successful for DN uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com

6.  Add ACI with the timeofday set to whatever makes the current time invalid. This example uses any time in the morning when the current time is in the afternoon. (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/add_aci_wrong_time.ldif)

7.  Repeat step 3. 

Error 50 (Insufficient Access Rights) results. 

The output is like that in step 3. 

8.  Replace the ACI with a time that does not conform to the standard described in the users guide. This example uses 12:00 for the timeofday. (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/add_aci_bad_time.ldif)

Error 21 (Invalid Attribute Syntax) results.

/tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapmodify -a -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password -f /tmp/manual_tests/add_aci_bad_time.ldif   
Processing MODIFY request for ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation failed
Result Code:  21 (Invalid Attribute Syntax)
Additional Information:  When attempting to modify entry ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com to replace the set of values for attribute aci, value "(targetattr="*")(version 3.0; acl "add_aci_right_day"; allow (add,delete,write) timeofday>"12:00";)" was found to be invalid according to the associated syntax:  The provided Access Control Instruction (ACI) bind rule timeofday expression value "12:00" is invalid. A valid timeofday value is expressed as four digits representing hours and minutes in the 24-hour clock (0 to 2359)

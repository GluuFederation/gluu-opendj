Manual test for Issue 462, Access Control "dns" Client Target

1.  Unzip and start OpenDS.

2.  Add some entries (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/aci_startup.ldif).

Note there is a user, uid=auser,ou=People,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
which will modify the entry, uid=scarter, ou=People, ou=aci branch, o=ACI Tests, dc=example,dc=com.

3.  The user, uid=auser, attempts to modify entry, uid=scarter (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/replace_l.ldif).

Error 50 (Insufficient Access Rights) results.

/tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapmodify -a -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "uid=auser,ou=People,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w ACIRules -f /tmp/manual_tests/replace_l.ldif 
Processing MODIFY request for uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation failed
Result Code:  50 (Insufficient Access Rights)
Additional Information:  The entry uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com cannot be modified due to insufficient access rights

4.  Add ACI with the dns set to whatever the server machine you are testing with. In this example, we are on a private network and the domain is simply auseng013. (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/add_aci_right_domain.ldif)

5.  Repeat step 3. Now it is successful.

/tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapmodify -a -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "uid=auser,ou=People,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w ACIRules -f /tmp/manual_tests/replace_l.ldif 
Processing MODIFY request for uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation successful for DN uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com

6.  Replace the ACI with some other machine name. This example sets the dns to pecos.central.sun.com. (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/add_aci_wrong_domain.ldif)

7.  Repeat step 3. 

Error 50 (Insufficient Access Rights) results. 

The output is like that in step 3. 

8.  Replace the ACI with a dns value that contains a wildcard and works for the current machine. This example uses simply * for the dns. (shared/data/aci/manual_tests/add_aci_wildcard_domain.ldif) 

The modify is successful.

/tmp/mikek/OpenDS-0.9.0-build004/bin/ldapmodify -a -h auseng013 -p 389 -D "uid=auser,ou=People,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com" -w ACIRules -f /tmp/manual_tests/replace_l.ldif 
Processing MODIFY request for uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com
MODIFY operation successful for DN uid=scarter,ou=People,ou=aci branch,o=ACI Tests,dc=example,dc=com

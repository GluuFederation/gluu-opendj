# This file contains a list of generic issues that arise accross potentially
# multiple DSML suites. 
# The expected format is : ISSUEID[_label][.r]=substring | regexp
# When suffixed with '.r' the string is assumed to be a valid java regexp
#   see : http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/1.4regex
#
# examples :
#
#0001_generic=<errorMessage>The maximum time limit of 1 seconds for processing this search operation has expired</errorMessage>
#0002_import=<errorMessage>You do not have sufficient privileges to perform an unindexed search</errorMessage>
#0003.r=.*maximum.*
#0004_generic.r.r=[^@]privileges
#
# multiple string might correspond to a single bug, hence property are better
# sorted out by ISSUEID
# Note : the lookup will raise an issue for the first match

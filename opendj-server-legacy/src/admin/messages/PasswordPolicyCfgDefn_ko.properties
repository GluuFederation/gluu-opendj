property.deprecated-password-storage-scheme.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced password storage schemes must be enabled.
property.expire-passwords-without-warning.synopsis=Indicates whether the Directory Server allows a user's password to expire even if that user has never seen an expiration warning notification.
property.expire-passwords-without-warning.description=If this property is true, accounts always expire when the expiration time arrives. If this property is false disabled, the user always receives at least one warning notification, and the password expiration is set to the warning time plus the warning interval.
property.force-change-on-add.synopsis=Indicates whether users are forced to change their passwords upon first authenticating to the Directory Server after their account has been created.
property.force-change-on-reset.synopsis=Indicates whether users are forced to change their passwords if they are reset by an administrator.

property.grace-login-count.description=A value of 0 indicates that no grace logins are allowed.
property.idle-lockout-interval.synopsis=Specifies the maximum length of time that an account may remain idle (that is, the associated user does not authenticate to the server) before that user is locked out.
property.idle-lockout-interval.description=The value of this attribute is an integer followed by a unit of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. A value of 0 seconds indicates that idle accounts are not automatically locked out. This feature is available only if the last login time is maintained.

property.max-password-age.description=The value of this attribute is an integer followed by a unit of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. A value of 0 seconds disables password expiration.
property.max-password-reset-age.synopsis=Specifies the maximum length of time that users have to change passwords after they have been reset by an administrator before they become locked.
property.max-password-reset-age.description=The value of this attribute is an integer followed by a unit of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. A value of 0 seconds disables this feature.

property.min-password-age.description=The value of this attribute is an integer followed by a unit of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. This setting can be used to prevent users from changing their passwords repeatedly over a short period of time to flush an old password from the history so that it can be re-used.

property.password-expiration-warning-interval.description=The value of this attribute is an integer followed by a unit of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. A value of 0 seconds disables the warning interval.
property.password-generator.synopsis=Specifies the name of the password generator that is used with the associated password policy.
property.password-generator.description=This is used in conjunction with the password modify extended operation to generate a new password for a user when none was provided in the request.
property.password-generator.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced password generator must be enabled.
property.password-history-count.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of former passwords to maintain in the password history.
property.password-history-count.description=When choosing a new password, the proposed password is checked to ensure that it does not match the current password, nor any other password in the history list. A value of zero indicates that either no password history is to be maintained (if the password history duration has a value of zero seconds), or that there is no maximum number of passwords to maintain in the history (if the password history duration has a value greater than zero seconds).
property.password-history-duration.synopsis=Specifies the maximum length of time that passwords remain in the password history.
property.password-history-duration.description=When choosing a new password, the proposed password is checked to ensure that it does not match the current password, nor any other password in the history list. A value of zero seconds indicates that either no password history is to be maintained (if the password history count has a value of zero), or that there is no maximum duration for passwords in the history (if the password history count has a value greater than zero).
property.password-validator.synopsis=Specifies the names of the password validators that are used with the associated password storage scheme.
property.password-validator.description=The password validators are invoked when a user attempts to provide a new password, to determine whether the new password is acceptable.
property.password-validator.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced password validators must be enabled.
property.previous-last-login-time-format.synopsis=Specifies the format string(s) that might have been used with the last login time at any point in the past for users associated with the password policy.
property.previous-last-login-time-format.description=These values are used to make it possible to parse previous values, but are not used to set new values. The format strings conform to the syntax described in the API documentation for the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class.
property.previous-last-login-time-format.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=Any valid format string that can be used with the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class.
property.require-change-by-time.synopsis=Specifies the time by which all users with the associated password policy must change their passwords.
property.require-change-by-time.description=The value is expressed in a generalized time format. If this time is equal to the current time or is in the past, then all users are required to change their passwords immediately. The behavior of the server in this mode is identical to the behavior observed when users are forced to change their passwords after an administrative reset.
property.require-change-by-time.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A valid timestamp in generalized time form (for example, a value of "20070409185811Z" indicates a value of April 9, 2007 at 6:58:11 pm GMT).
property.require-secure-authentication.synopsis=Indicates whether users with the associated password policy are required to authenticate in a secure manner.
property.require-secure-authentication.description=This might mean either using a secure communication channel between the client and the server, or using a SASL mechanism that does not expose the credentials.
property.require-secure-password-changes.synopsis=Indicates whether users with the associated password policy are required to change their password in a secure manner that does not expose the credentials.
property.skip-validation-for-administrators.synopsis=Indicates whether passwords set by administrators are allowed to bypass the password validation process that is required for user password changes.
property.state-update-failure-policy.synopsis=Specifies how the server deals with the inability to update password policy state information during an authentication attempt.
property.state-update-failure-policy.description=In particular, this property can be used to control whether an otherwise successful bind operation fails if a failure occurs while attempting to update password policy state information (for example, to clear a record of previous authentication failures or to update the last login time). It can also be used to control whether to reject a bind request if it is known ahead of time that it will not be possible to update the authentication failure times in the event of an unsuccessful bind attempt (for example, if the backend writability mode is disabled).
property.state-update-failure-policy.syntax.enumeration.value.ignore.synopsis=If a bind attempt would otherwise be successful, then do not reject it if a problem occurs while attempting to update the password policy state information for the user.
property.state-update-failure-policy.syntax.enumeration.value.proactive.synopsis=Proactively reject any bind attempt if it is known ahead of time that it would not be possible to update the user's password policy state information.
property.state-update-failure-policy.syntax.enumeration.value.reactive.synopsis=Even if a bind attempt would otherwise be successful, reject it if a problem occurs while attempting to update the password policy state information for the user.

Once this value is crossed, the matching directory server goes in degraded status.

property.group-id.synopsis=The group id for the replication server.

property.queue-size.synopsis=Specifies the number of changes that are kept in memory for each Directory Server in the Replication Domain.
property.replication-db-directory.synopsis=The path where the Replication Server stores all persistent information.
property.replication-port.synopsis=The port on which this Replication Server waits for connections from other Replication Servers or Directory Servers.
property.replication-purge-delay.synopsis=The time (in seconds) after which the Replication Server erases all persistent information.
property.replication-server.synopsis=Specifies the addresses of other Replication Servers to which this Replication Server tries to connect at startup time.
property.replication-server.description=Addresses must be specified using the syntax: hostname:port
property.replication-server.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A host name followed by a ":" and a port number.
property.replication-server-id.synopsis=Specifies a unique identifier for the Replication Server.

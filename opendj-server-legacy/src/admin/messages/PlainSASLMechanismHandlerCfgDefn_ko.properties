user-friendly-plural-name=Plain SASL Mechanism Handlers
synopsis=The Plain SASL Mechanism Handler performs all processing related to SASL PLAIN authentication.
description=The PLAIN SASL mechanism provides the ability for clients to authenticate using a username and password. This authentication is very similar to standard LDAP simple authentication, with the exception that it can authenticate based on an authentication ID (for example, a username) rather than requiring a full DN, and it can also include an authorization ID in addition to the authentication ID. Note that the SASL PLAIN mechanism does not make any attempt to protect the password.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the SASL mechanism handler is enabled for use.
property.identity-mapper.synopsis=Specifies the name of the identity mapper that is to be used with this SASL mechanism handler to match the authentication or authorization ID included in the SASL bind request to the corresponding user in the directory.
property.identity-mapper.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced identity mapper must be enabled when the Plain SASL Mechanism Handler is enabled.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the SASL mechanism handler implementation.

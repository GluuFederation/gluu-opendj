user-friendly-plural-name=Access Control Handlers
synopsis=Access Control Handlers manage the application-wide access control. The OpenDJ access control handler is defined through an extensible interface, so that alternate implementations can be created. Only one access control handler may be active in the server at any given time.
description=Note that OpenDJ also has a privilege subsystem, which may have an impact on what clients may be allowed to do in the server. For example, any user with the bypass-acl privilege is not subject to access control checking regardless of whether the access control implementation is enabled.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the Access Control Handler is enabled. If set to FALSE, then no access control is enforced, and any client (including unauthenticated or anonymous clients) could be allowed to perform any operation if not subject to other restrictions, such as those enforced by the privilege subsystem.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the Access Control Handler implementation.

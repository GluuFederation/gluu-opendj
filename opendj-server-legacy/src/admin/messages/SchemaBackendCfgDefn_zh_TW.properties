user-friendly-name=Schema Backend
user-friendly-plural-name=Schema Backends
synopsis=The Schema Backend provides access to the Directory Server schema information, including the attribute types, object classes, attribute syntaxes, matching rules, matching rule uses, DIT content rules, and DIT structure rules that it contains.
description=The server allows "modify" operations in this backend to alter the server schema definitions. The configuration entry for this backend is based on the ds-cfg-schema-backend structural object class. Note that any attribute types included in this entry that are not included in this object class (or the parent ds-cfg-backend class) appears directly in the schema entry.
property.backend-id.synopsis=Specifies a name to identify the associated backend.
property.backend-id.description=The name must be unique among all backends in the server. The backend ID may not be altered after the backend is created in the server.
property.base-dn.synopsis=Specifies the base DN(s) for the data that the backend handles.
property.base-dn.description=A single backend may be responsible for one or more base DNs. Note that no two backends may have the same base DN although one backend may have a base DN that is below a base DN provided by another backend (similar to the use of sub-suffixes in the Sun Java System Directory Server). If any of the base DNs is subordinate to a base DN for another backend, then all base DNs for that backend must be subordinate to that same base DN.
property.base-dn.requires-admin-action.synopsis=No administrative action is required by default although some action may be required on a per-backend basis before the new base DN may be used.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the backend is enabled in the server.
property.enabled.description=If a backend is not enabled, then its contents are not accessible when processing operations.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the backend implementation.
property.schema-entry-dn.synopsis=Defines the base DNs of the subtrees in which the schema information is published in addition to the value included in the base-dn property.
property.schema-entry-dn.description=The value provided in the base-dn property is the only one that appears in the subschemaSubentry operational attribute of the server's root DSE (which is necessary because that is a single-valued attribute) and as a virtual attribute in other entries. The schema-entry-dn attribute may be used to make the schema information available in other locations to accommodate certain client applications that have been hard-coded to expect the schema to reside in a specific location.
property.show-all-attributes.synopsis=Indicates whether to treat all attributes in the schema entry as if they were user attributes regardless of their configuration.
property.show-all-attributes.description=This may provide compatibility with some applications that expect schema attributes like attributeTypes and objectClasses to be included by default even if they are not requested. Note that the ldapSyntaxes attribute is always treated as operational in order to avoid problems with attempts to modify the schema over protocol.
property.writability-mode.synopsis=Specifies the behavior that the backend should use when processing write operations.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.disabled.synopsis=Causes all write attempts to fail.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.enabled.synopsis=Allows write operations to be performed in that backend (if the requested operation is valid, the user has permission to perform the operation, the backend supports that type of write operation, and the global writability mode property is also enabled).
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.internal-only.synopsis=Causes external write attempts to fail but allows writes by replication and internal operations.

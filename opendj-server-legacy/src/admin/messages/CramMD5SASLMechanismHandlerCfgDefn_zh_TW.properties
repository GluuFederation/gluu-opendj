user-friendly-plural-name=Cram MD5 SASL Mechanism Handlers
synopsis=The CRAM-MD5 SASL mechanism provides the ability for clients to perform password-based authentication in a manner that does not expose their password in the clear.
description=Rather than including the password in the bind request, the CRAM-MD5 mechanism uses a two-step process in which the client needs only to prove that it knows the password. The server sends randomly-generated data to the client that is to be used in the process, which makes it resistant to replay attacks. The one-way message digest algorithm ensures that the original clear-text password is not exposed. Note that the algorithm used by the CRAM-MD5 mechanism requires that both the client and the server have access to the clear-text password (or potentially a value that is derived from the clear-text password). In order to authenticate to the server using CRAM-MD5, the password for a user's account must be encoded using a reversible password storage scheme that allows the server to have access to the clear-text value.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the SASL mechanism handler is enabled for use.
property.identity-mapper.synopsis=Specifies the name of the identity mapper used with this SASL mechanism handler to match the authentication ID included in the SASL bind request to the corresponding user in the directory.
property.identity-mapper.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced identity mapper must be enabled when the Cram MD5 SASL Mechanism Handler is enabled.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the SASL mechanism handler implementation.

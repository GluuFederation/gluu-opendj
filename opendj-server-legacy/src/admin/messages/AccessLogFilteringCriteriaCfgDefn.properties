user-friendly-plural-name=Access Log Filtering Criteria
synopsis=A set of rules which together determine whether a log record should be logged or not.
property.connection-client-address-equal-to.synopsis=Filters log records associated with connections which match at least one of the specified client host names or address masks.
property.connection-client-address-equal-to.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask.
property.connection-client-address-not-equal-to.synopsis=Filters log records associated with connections which do not match any of the specified client host names or address masks.
property.connection-client-address-not-equal-to.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask.
property.connection-port-equal-to.synopsis=Filters log records associated with connections to any of the specified listener port numbers.
property.connection-protocol-equal-to.synopsis=Filters log records associated with connections which match any of the specified protocols.
property.connection-protocol-equal-to.description=Typical values include "ldap", "ldaps", or "jmx".
property.connection-protocol-equal-to.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=The protocol name as reported in the access log.
property.log-record-type.synopsis=Filters log records based on their type.
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.abandon.synopsis=Abandon operations
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.add.synopsis=Add operations
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.bind.synopsis=Bind operations
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.compare.synopsis=Compare operations
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.connect.synopsis=Client connections
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.delete.synopsis=Delete operations
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.disconnect.synopsis=Client disconnections
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.extended.synopsis=Extended operations
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.modify.synopsis=Modify operations

property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.search.synopsis=Search operations
property.log-record-type.syntax.enumeration.value.unbind.synopsis=Unbind operations
property.request-target-dn-equal-to.synopsis=Filters operation log records associated with operations which target entries matching at least one of the specified DN patterns.
property.request-target-dn-equal-to.description=Valid DN filters are strings composed of zero or more wildcards. A double wildcard ** replaces one or more RDN components (as in uid=dmiller,**,dc=example,dc=com). A simple wildcard * replaces either a whole RDN, or a whole type, or a value substring (as in uid=bj*,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com).
property.request-target-dn-not-equal-to.synopsis=Filters operation log records associated with operations which target entries matching none of the specified DN patterns.
property.request-target-dn-not-equal-to.description=Valid DN filters are strings composed of zero or more wildcards. A double wildcard ** replaces one or more RDN components (as in uid=dmiller,**,dc=example,dc=com). A simple wildcard * replaces either a whole RDN, or a whole type, or a value substring (as in uid=bj*,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com).
property.response-etime-greater-than.synopsis=Filters operation response log records associated with operations which took longer than the specified number of milli-seconds to complete.
property.response-etime-greater-than.description=It is recommended to only use this criteria in conjunction with the "combined" output mode of the access logger, since this filter criteria is only applied to response log messages.
property.response-etime-less-than.synopsis=Filters operation response log records associated with operations which took less than the specified number of milli-seconds to complete.
property.response-etime-less-than.description=It is recommended to only use this criteria in conjunction with the "combined" output mode of the access logger, since this filter criteria is only applied to response log messages.
property.response-result-code-equal-to.synopsis=Filters operation response log records associated with operations which include any of the specified result codes.
property.response-result-code-equal-to.description=It is recommended to only use this criteria in conjunction with the "combined" output mode of the access logger, since this filter criteria is only applied to response log messages.
property.response-result-code-not-equal-to.synopsis=Filters operation response log records associated with operations which do not include any of the specified result codes.
property.response-result-code-not-equal-to.description=It is recommended to only use this criteria in conjunction with the "combined" output mode of the access logger, since this filter criteria is only applied to response log messages.
property.search-response-is-indexed.synopsis=Filters search operation response log records associated with searches which were either indexed or unindexed.
property.search-response-is-indexed.description=It is recommended to only use this criteria in conjunction with the "combined" output mode of the access logger, since this filter criteria is only applied to response log messages.
property.search-response-nentries-greater-than.synopsis=Filters search operation response log records associated with searches which returned more than the specified number of entries.
property.search-response-nentries-greater-than.description=It is recommended to only use this criteria in conjunction with the "combined" output mode of the access logger, since this filter criteria is only applied to response log messages.
property.search-response-nentries-less-than.synopsis=Filters search operation response log records associated with searches which returned less than the specified number of entries.
property.search-response-nentries-less-than.description=It is recommended to only use this criteria in conjunction with the "combined" output mode of the access logger, since this filter criteria is only applied to response log messages.
property.user-dn-equal-to.synopsis=Filters log records associated with users matching at least one of the specified DN patterns.
property.user-dn-equal-to.description=Valid DN filters are strings composed of zero or more wildcards. A double wildcard ** replaces one or more RDN components (as in uid=dmiller,**,dc=example,dc=com). A simple wildcard * replaces either a whole RDN, or a whole type, or a value substring (as in uid=bj*,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com).
property.user-dn-not-equal-to.synopsis=Filters log records associated with users which do not match any of the specified DN patterns.
property.user-dn-not-equal-to.description=Valid DN filters are strings composed of zero or more wildcards. A double wildcard ** replaces one or more RDN components (as in uid=dmiller,**,dc=example,dc=com).

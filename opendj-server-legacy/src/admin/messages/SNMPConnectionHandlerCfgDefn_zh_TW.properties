user-friendly-name=SNMP Connection Handler
user-friendly-plural-name=SNMP Connection Handlers
synopsis=The SNMP Connection Handler can be used to process SNMP requests to retrieve monitoring information described by the MIB 2605. Supported protocol are SNMP V1, V2c and V3.
description=The SNMP connection handler will process SNMP requests sent by SNMP Managers to retrieve information described the MIB 2605. To enable the SNMP Connection Handler, the ds-cfg-opendmk-jarfile parameter has to be set to the OpenDMK jar files location.
property.allowed-client.synopsis=Specifies a set of host names or address masks that determine the clients that are allowed to establish connections to this connection handler.
property.allowed-client.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask.
property.allowed-client.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=All clients with addresses that do not match an address on the deny list are allowed. If there is no deny list, then all clients are allowed.
property.allowed-client.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this configuration attribute take effect immediately and do not interfere with connections that may have already been established.
property.allowed-manager.synopsis=Specifies the hosts of the managers to be granted the access rights. This property is required for SNMP v1 and v2 security configuration. An asterik (*) opens access to all managers.
property.allowed-user.synopsis=Specifies the users to be granted the access rights. This property is required for SNMP v3 security configuration. An asterik (*) opens access to all users.
property.community.synopsis=Specifies the v1,v2 community or the v3 context name allowed to access the MIB 2605 monitoring information or the USM MIB. The mapping between "community" and "context name" is set.
property.denied-client.synopsis=Specifies a set of host names or address masks that determine the clients that are not allowed to establish connections to this connection handler.
property.denied-client.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask. If both allowed and denied client masks are defined and a client connection matches one or more masks in both lists, then the connection is denied. If only a denied list is specified, then any client not matching a mask in that list is allowed.
property.denied-client.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=If an allow list is specified, then only clients with addresses on the allow list are allowed. Otherwise, all clients are allowed.
property.denied-client.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this configuration attribute take effect immediately and do not interfere with connections that may have already been established.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the SNMP Connection Handler is enabled.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the SNMP Connection Handler implementation.
property.listen-port.synopsis=Specifies the port number on which the SNMP Connection Handler will listen for connections from clients.
property.listen-port.description=Only a single port number may be provided.
property.opendmk-jarfile.synopsis=Indicates the OpenDMK runtime jar file location
property.registered-mbean.synopsis=Indicates whether the SNMP objects have to be registered in the Directory Server MBeanServer or not allowing to access SNMP Objects with RMI connector if enabled.
property.security-agent-file.synopsis=Specifies the USM security configuration to receive authenticated only SNMP requests.
property.security-level.synopsis=Specifies the type of security level : NoAuthNoPriv : No security mechanisms activated, AuthNoPriv : Authentication activated with no privacy, AuthPriv : Authentication with privacy activated. This property id required for SNMP V3 security configuration.
property.security-level.syntax.enumeration.value.authnopriv.synopsis=Authentication activated with no privacy.
property.security-level.syntax.enumeration.value.authpriv.synopsis=Authentication with privacy activated.
property.security-level.syntax.enumeration.value.noauthnopriv.synopsis=No security mechanisms activated.
property.trap-port.synopsis=Specifies the port to use to send SNMP Traps.
property.traps-community.synopsis=Specifies the community string that must be include in the traps sent to define managers (trap-destinations). This property is used in the context of SNMP v1, v2 and v3.
property.traps-destination.synopsis=Specifies the hosts to which V1 traps will be sent. V1 Traps are sent to every host listed.
property.traps-destination.description=If this list is empty, V1 traps are sent to "localhost". Each host in the list must be identifed by its name or complete IP Addess.
property.traps-destination.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=If the list is empty, V1 traps are sent to "localhost".

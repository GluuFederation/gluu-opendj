user-friendly-name=Task Backend
user-friendly-plural-name=Task Backends
synopsis=The Task Backend provides a mechanism for scheduling tasks in the OpenDJ directory server. Tasks are intended to provide access to certain types of administrative functions in the server that may not be convenient to perform remotely.
description=OpenDJ supports tasks to backup and restore backends, to import and export LDIF files, and to stop and restart the server. The details of a task are in an entry that is below the root of the Task Backend. The Task Backend is responsible for decoding that task entry and ensuring that it is processed as requested. Tasks may be invoked immediately, but they may also be scheduled for execution at some future time. The task backend can also process recurring tasks to ensure that maintenance operations (for example, backups) are performed automatically on a regular basis.
property.backend-id.synopsis=Specifies a name to identify the associated backend.
property.backend-id.description=The name must be unique among all backends in the server. The backend ID may not be altered after the backend is created in the server.
property.base-dn.synopsis=Specifies the base DN(s) for the data that the backend handles.
property.base-dn.description=A single backend may be responsible for one or more base DNs. Note that no two backends may have the same base DN although one backend may have a base DN that is below a base DN provided by another backend (similar to the use of sub-suffixes in the Sun Java System Directory Server). If any of the base DNs is subordinate to a base DN for another backend, then all base DNs for that backend must be subordinate to that same base DN.
property.base-dn.requires-admin-action.synopsis=No administrative action is required by default although some action may be required on a per-backend basis before the new base DN may be used.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the backend is enabled in the server.
property.enabled.description=If a backend is not enabled, then its contents are not accessible when processing operations.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the backend implementation.
property.notification-sender-address.synopsis=Specifies the email address to use as the sender (that is, the "From:" address) address for notification mail messages generated when a task completes execution.
property.notification-sender-address.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=The default sender address used is "opendj-task-notification@" followed by the canonical address of the system on which the server is running.
property.task-backing-file.synopsis=Specifies the path to the backing file for storing information about the tasks configured in the server.
property.task-backing-file.description=It may be either an absolute path or a relative path to the base of the OpenDJ directory server instance.
property.task-retention-time.synopsis=Specifies the length of time that task entries should be retained after processing on the associated task has been completed.
property.writability-mode.synopsis=Specifies the behavior that the backend should use when processing write operations.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.disabled.synopsis=Causes all write attempts to fail.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.enabled.synopsis=Allows write operations to be performed in that backend (if the requested operation is valid, the user has permission to perform the operation, the backend supports that type of write operation, and the global writability-mode property is also enabled).
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.internal-only.synopsis=Causes external write attempts to fail but allows writes by replication and internal operations.

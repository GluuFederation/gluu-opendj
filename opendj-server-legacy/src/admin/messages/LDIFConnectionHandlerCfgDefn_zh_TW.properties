user-friendly-plural-name=LDIF Connection Handlers
synopsis=The LDIF Connection Handler is used to process changes in the server using internal operations, where the changes to process are read from an LDIF file.
description=The connection handler periodically looks for the existence of a new file, processes the changes contained in that file as internal operations, and writse the result to an output file with comments indicating the result of the processing. NOTE: By default LDIF Connection Handler operations are not logged because they are internal operations. If you want to log these operations, allow internal logging in the access log publisher.
property.allowed-client.synopsis=Specifies a set of host names or address masks that determine the clients that are allowed to establish connections to this connection handler.
property.allowed-client.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask.
property.allowed-client.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=All clients with addresses that do not match an address on the deny list are allowed. If there is no deny list, then all clients are allowed.
property.allowed-client.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this configuration attribute take effect immediately and do not interfere with connections that may have already been established.
property.denied-client.synopsis=Specifies a set of host names or address masks that determine the clients that are not allowed to establish connections to this connection handler.
property.denied-client.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask. If both allowed and denied client masks are defined and a client connection matches one or more masks in both lists, then the connection is denied. If only a denied list is specified, then any client not matching a mask in that list is allowed.
property.denied-client.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=If an allow list is specified, then only clients with addresses on the allow list are allowed. Otherwise, all clients are allowed.
property.denied-client.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this configuration attribute take effect immediately and do not interfere with connections that may have already been established.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the LDIF Connection Handler is enabled.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the LDIF Connection Handler implementation.
property.ldif-directory.synopsis=Specifies the path to the directory in which the LDIF files should be placed.
property.poll-interval.synopsis=Specifies how frequently the LDIF connection handler should check the LDIF directory to determine whether a new LDIF file has been added.

user-friendly-plural-name=SHA1 Password Storage Schemes
synopsis=The SHA1 Password Storage Scheme provides a mechanism for encoding user passwords using an unsalted form of the SHA-1 message digest algorithm. Because the implementation does not use any kind of salting mechanism, a given password always has the same encoded form.
description=This scheme contains only an implementation for the user password syntax, with a storage scheme name of "SHA".
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the SHA1 Password Storage Scheme is enabled for use.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the SHA1 Password Storage Scheme implementation.

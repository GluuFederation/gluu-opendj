Source files for the man pages are partially generated from tools sources,
partially hand-written.
See `GeneratedRefEntriesMojo` in `opendj-maven-plugin` for details.

The sources here are the hand-written pages and sections.

These sections are Xincluded into the generated sources at build time.
As a section might be Xincluded more than once in the same document,
none of the hand-written sections here has `xml:id` values.

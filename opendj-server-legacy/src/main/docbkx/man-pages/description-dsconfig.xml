 <para>
  The <command>dsconfig</command> command is the primary command-line tool
  for viewing and editing OpenDJ configuration.
  When started without arguments,
  <command>dsconfig</command> prompts you for administration connection information,
  including the host name, administration port number,
  administrator bind DN and administrator password.
  The <command>dsconfig</command> command then connects securely
  to the directory server over the administration port.
  Once connected it presents you with a menu-driven interface to the server configuration.
 </para>

 <para>
  When you pass connection information, subcommands, and additional options
  to <command>dsconfig</command>,
  the command runs in script mode and so is not interactive,
  though it can prompt you to ask whether to apply changes
  and whether to trust certificates
  (unless you use the <option>--no-prompt</option>
  and <option>--trustAll</option> options, respectively).
 </para>

 <para>
  You can prepare <command>dsconfig</command> batch scripts
  by running the tool with the <option>--commandFilePath</option> option
  in interactive mode,
  then reading from the batch file with the <option>--batchFilePath</option> option
  in script mode.
  Batch files can be useful when you have many <command>dsconfig</command> commands to run
  and want to avoid starting the JVM and setting up a new connection for each command.
 </para>

 <para>
  The <command>dsconfig</command> command categorizes
  directory server configuration into <firstterm>components</firstterm>,
  also called <firstterm>managed objects</firstterm>.
  Actual components often inherit from a parent component type.
  For example, one component is a Connection Handler.
  An LDAP Connection Handler is a type of Connection Handler.
  You configure the LDAP Connection Handler component
  to specify how OpenDJ directory server handles LDAP connections
  coming from client applications.
 </para>

 <para>
  Configuration components have <firstterm>properties</firstterm>.
  For example, the LDAP Connection Handler component has properties
  such as <literal>listen-port</literal> and <literal>allow-start-tls</literal>.
  You can set the component's <literal>listen-port</literal> property
  to <literal>389</literal> to use the default LDAP port number.
  You can set the component's <literal>allow-start-tls</literal> property
  to <literal>true</literal> to permit LDAP client applications to use StartTLS.
  Much of the configuration you do with <command>dsconfig</command>
  involves setting component properties.

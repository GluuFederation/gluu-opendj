This folder contains source code for an example "Hello World" style
plugin. It features a plugin which has a configurable message (the
default being "Hello World") which is displayed as a notice message
when OpenDJ directory server is started.

In order to build and use this example plugin, perform the following
steps while the server is stopped:

  1. Then unzip the example-plugin.zip (in place):

     unzip example-plugin.zip

  2. Go into the example-plugin source folder:

     cd example-plugin

  3. And build the plugin (this requires Ant version 7 and Xalan-Java):

     ant install

     If this step fails for you as is, you can find Ant 7 and Xalan-Java
     in the OpenDJ ext/ directory after checking the source out with
     Subversion. Substitute your full path to OpenDJ sources for /src
     in the following command:

     /src/ext/ant/bin/ant -Dxalan.directory=/src/ext/xalan-j/ install

  4. This will copy the following files into the parent OpenDJ
     installation:

     lib/extensions/example-plugin.jar
     config/example-plugin.ldif
     config/schema/99-example-plugin.ldif

  5. Add the plugin's config to the server configuration.

     cd ../bin
     ./start-ds
     ./dsconfig -h `hostname` -p 4444 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w password
      create-plugin --plugin-name "Example Plugin" --type example
      --set enabled:true --set plugin-type:startup
      --set java-class:com.example.opends.ExamplePlugin -X -n

  6. Restart the server and look for the "hello world" notice in the start
     up log:

     ./stop-ds --restart

 will take effect immediately but will not interfere with connections that might \
 already be established
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_LDAPV2_219=Indicates whether to allow \

 use the TCP KeepAlive feature for client connections established through this \
 connection handler.  This is recommended because it might help the server \
 detect client connections that are no longer valid, and might help prevent \
 intermediate network devices from closing connections due to a lack of \
 communication.  Changes to this configuration attribute will take effect \
 immediately but will only be applied to connections established after the \
 change

 use the TCP NoDelay feature for client connections established through this \
 connection handler.  This is recommended because it will generally allow \
 faster responses to clients, although directories that frequently process \
 searches that match multiple entries might be able to achieve higher throughput \
 if it is disabled.  Changes to this configuration attribute will take effect \
 immediately but will only be applied to connections established after the \
 change
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_REUSE_ADDRESS_224=Indicates whether \
 to use the SO_REUSEADDR socket option for the socket accepting connections \

 disabled and re-enabled, or until the Directory Server is restarted
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE_225=Maximum \
 size in bytes that will be allowed when reading requests from clients.  This \
 can be used to prevent denial of service attacks from clients that send \
 extremely large requests.  A value of zero indicates that no limit should be \
 imposed.  Changes to this configuration attribute will take effect \
 immediately
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_USE_SSL_226=Indicates whether this \

 is restarted
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_STARTTLS_227=Indicates whether this \
 connection handler should allow clients to use the StartTLS extended \
 operation to initiate secure communication over a non-SSL LDAP connection. \
 This can not be used if SSL is enabled for the connection handler.  Changes \
 to this configuration attribute will take effect immediately for LDAP clients
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_POLICY_228=Policy that \
 should be used regarding requesting or requiring the client to \
 present its own certificate when establishing an SSL-based connection or \

 is restarted
INFO_LDAP_CONNHANDLER_DESCRIPTION_SSL_CERT_NICKNAME_229=Nickname of the \
 certificate that the connection handler should use when \
 accepting SSL-based connections or performing StartTLS negotiation.  Changes \

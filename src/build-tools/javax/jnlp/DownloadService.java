/**
 * This is just an empty implementation of DownloadService.  It does define
 * only the methods of the JNLP API used in the class 
 * org.opends.quicksetup.webstart.WebstartDownloader.
 * 
 * We have chosen to do this because we we require the JNLP API to be compiled
 * but the location of the javaws.jar depends on the java distribution, so
 * instead of trying to figure out where javaws.jar is on the java distribution
 * that is being used to compile the source, we just add these classes to the
 * build-tools.jar file that will be used to compile que QuickSetup.
 * 
 * It must be noted that the class 
 * org.opends.quicksetup.webstart.WebstartDownloader will be only executed in
 * the context of a Java Web Start application and that in this case the
 * javaws.jar will be provided by the Java Web Start Runtime environment.  So
 * we are not providing the javaws-stub.jar during runtime: it is used only
 * for compilation.

/**
 * This class is for reading ASN.1 elements from a readable byte
 * channel. It will handle all partial element reads from the channel
 * and save any unread ASN.1 elements if required. All data read from
 * the channel will be ready to be read as ASN.1 elements no matter
 * how many times the channel is read. However, to minimize the the
 * amount of memory used by this reader, the client should read ASN.1
 * elements as soon as they are read off the channel.
 * <p>
 * {@code ASN1ByteChannelReader}s are created using the factory
 * methods in {@link ASN1}.
 * <p>
 * The client should use this class in the following manner:
 *<p>
 * When NIO signals new data is available in the channel, the client
 * should call {@link #processChannelData()}.
 *<p>
 * If bytes are read from the channel, the client should call
 * {@link #elementAvailable()} to see if a complete element is ready to
 * be read. However, if no data is actually read, the client should
 * wait for the next signal and try again.
 * <p>
 * As long as a complete element is ready, the client should read the
 * appropriate ASN.1 element(s). Once no more complete elements are
 * available, the client should call {@link #processChannelData()}
 * again to read more data (if available).
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Since this reader is non blocking, reading ASN.1
 * elements before making sure they are ready could result in
 * {@link IllegalBlockingModeException}s being thrown while reading
 * ASN.1 elements. Once an exception is thrown, the state of the reader
 * is no longer stable and can not be used again.

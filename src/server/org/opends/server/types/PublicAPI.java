/**
 * This class defines an annotation type that can be used to describe
 * the position of a package, class, or method in the OpenDS public
 * API (including to denote that the associated code should NOT be
 * considered part of the public API).  Third-party developers should
 * pay attention to these annotations in order to understand how best
 * to interact with the OpenDS code.  For the purposes of this
 * annotation, a "third-party developer" should be assumed to refer to
 * anyone who is interacting with the OpenDS code in a manner in which
 * their work is not expected to become part of the core OpenDS code
 * base.
 * <BR><BR>
 * This annotation type may be used to describe things like:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>The stability of the code (how likely it is to change in the
 *       future and whether those changes may be incompatible with
 *       previous implementations).</LI>
 *   <LI>Whether third-party code may be allowed to create new
 *       instances of the associated object type.</LI>
 *   <LI>Whether a class or method may be extended by third-party
 *       code.</LI>
 *   <LI>Whether a class or method may be invoked by third-party
 *       code.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <BR><BR>
 * Note that for cases in which there are conflicting public API
 * annotations, the most specific annotation should be considered
 * authoritative.  For example, if a class is marked with
 * {@code mayInvoke=true} but a method in that class is marked with
 * {@code mayInvoke=false}, then third-party code should not attempt
 * to invoke that method because the method-level annotation is more
 * specific (and therefore overrides) the less-specific class-level
 * annotation.
 * <BR><BR>
 * If a method does not include this annotation, then it should be
 * assumed to inherit the class-level annotation.  If a class does not
 * include this annotation, then it should be assumed to inherit the
 * package-level annotation.  If a package does not include this
 * annotation, then it should be assumed the package is private and
 * should not be used by third-party code.

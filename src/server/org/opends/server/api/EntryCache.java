/**
 * This class defines the set of methods that must be implemented by a
 * Directory Server entry cache.  Note that components accessing the
 * entry cache must not depend on any particular behavior.  For
 * example, if a call is made to {@code putEntry} to store an entry in
 * the cache, there is no guarantee that immediately calling
 * {@code getEntry} will be able to retrieve it.  There are several
 * potential reasons for this, including:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>The entry may have been deleted or replaced by another thread
 *       between the {@code putEntry} and {@code getEntry} calls.</LI>
 *   <LI>The entry cache may implement a purging mechanism and the
 *       entry added may have been purged between the
 *       {@code putEntry} and {@code getEntry} calls.</LI>
 *   <LI>The entry cache may implement some kind of filtering
 *       mechanism to determine which entries to store, and entries
 *       not matching the appropriate criteria may not be stored.</LI>
 *   <LI>The entry cache may not actually store any entries (this is
 *       the behavior of the default cache if no implementation
 *       specific entry cache is available).</LI>
 * </UL>
 *
 * @param  <T>  The type of configuration handled by this entry
 *              cache.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This TC describes an object which counts events with the
        following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
        zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
        events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^32 is
        reached.

        Provided that an application discovers the new object within
        the minimum time to wrap it can use the initial value as a
        delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
        part.  It is important for a management station to be aware of
        this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and to
        discard data if the actual time is too long or there is no
        defined minimum time.

        Typically this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
        constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in use."

How To Install OpenDS
=====================

If you are reading this page, you have already installed the OpenDS package.

Before You Configure
------------------
A Java SE 5.0 (version 1.5.0_08) or higher runtime environment must be installed. It is 
recommended that your system have at least 100MB of disk space and 256MB of free memory to run 
OpenDS for evaluation purposes. Note that you can configure OpenDS in such a way that it requires 
substantially less, or more, disk space. For more information, see the OpenDS System Requirements 
at https://www.opends.org/wiki/page/OpenDSSystemRequirements.

To Configure OpenDS
--------------------------------------
  1. As root, type the following command:
     $BASEDIR/opends/configure --instancePath {instancePath} [ --userName {userName} [ --groupName {groupName} ] ] 
  2. As {userName}, type the following command:
     $BASEDIR/opends/setup

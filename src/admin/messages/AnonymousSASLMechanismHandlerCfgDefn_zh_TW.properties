user-friendly-plural-name=Anonymous SASL Mechanism Handlers
synopsis=The ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism provides the ability for clients to perform an anonymous bind using a SASL mechanism.
description=The only real benefit that this provides over a normal anonymous bind (that is, using simple authentication with no password) is that the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism also allows the client to include a trace string in the request. This trace string can help identify the application that performed the bind (although since there is no authentication, there is no assurance that some other client did not spoof that trace string).
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the SASL mechanism handler is enabled for use.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the SASL mechanism handler implementation.

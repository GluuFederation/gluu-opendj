user-friendly-plural-name=Base64 Password Storage Schemes
synopsis=The Base64 Password Storage Scheme provides a mechanism for encoding user passwords using the BASE64 encoding mechanism.
description=This scheme contains only an implementation for the user password syntax, with a storage scheme name of "BASE64". The Base64 Password Storage Scheme merely obscures the password so that the clear-text password is not available to casual observers. However, it offers no real protection and should only be used if there are client applications that specifically require this capability.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the Base64 Password Storage Scheme is enabled for use.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the Base64 Password Storage Scheme implementation.

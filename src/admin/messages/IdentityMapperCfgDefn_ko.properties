synopsis=Identity Mappers are responsible for establishing a mapping between an identifier string provided by a client, and the entry for the user that corresponds to that identifier. Identity Mappers are used to process several SASL mechanisms to map an authorization ID (e.g., a Kerberos principal when using GSSAPI) to a directory user. They are also used when processing requests with the proxied authorization control.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the Identity Mapper is enabled for use.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the Identity Mapper implementation.

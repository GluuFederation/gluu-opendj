user-friendly-name=Backup Backend
user-friendly-plural-name=Backup Backends
synopsis=The Backup Backend provides read-only access to the set of backups that are available for the OpenDJ.
description=It is provided as a convenience feature that makes it easier to determine what backups are available to be restored if necessary.
property.backend-id.synopsis=Specifies a name to identify the associated backend.
property.backend-id.description=The name must be unique among all backends in the server. The backend ID may not be altered after the backend is created in the server.
property.backup-directory.synopsis=Specifies the path to a backup directory containing one or more backups for a particular backend.
property.backup-directory.description=This is a multivalued property. Each value may specify a different backup directory if desired (one for each backend for which backups are taken). Values may be either absolute paths or paths that are relative to the base of the OpenDJ installation.
property.base-dn.synopsis=Specifies the base DN(s) for the data that the backend handles.
property.base-dn.description=A single backend may be responsible for one or more base DNs. Note that no two backends may have the same base DN although one backend may have a base DN that is below a base DN provided by another backend (similar to the use of sub-suffixes in the Sun Java System Directory Server). If any of the base DNs is subordinate to a base DN for another backend, then all base DNs for that backend must be subordinate to that same base DN.
property.base-dn.requires-admin-action.synopsis=No administrative action is required by default although some action may be required on a per-backend basis before the new base DN may be used.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the backend is enabled in the server.
property.enabled.description=If a backend is not enabled, then its contents are not accessible when processing operations.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the backend implementation.
property.writability-mode.synopsis=Specifies the behavior that the backend should use when processing write operations.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.disabled.synopsis=Causes all write attempts to fail.
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.enabled.synopsis=Allows write operations to be performed in that backend (if the requested operation is valid, the user has permission to perform the operation, the backend supports that type of write operation, and the global writability mode property is also enabled).
property.writability-mode.syntax.enumeration.value.internal-only.synopsis=Causes external write attempts to fail but allows writes by replication and internal operations.

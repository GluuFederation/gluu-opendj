user-friendly-plural-name=File Based Error Log Publishers
synopsis=File Based Error Log Publishers publish error messages to the file system.
property.append.synopsis=Specifies whether to append to existing log files.
property.asynchronous.synopsis=Indicates whether the File Based Error Log Publisher will publish records asynchronously.
property.auto-flush.synopsis=Specifies whether to flush the writer after every log record.
property.auto-flush.description=If the asynchronous writes option is used, the writer will be flushed after all the log records in the queue are written.
property.buffer-size.synopsis=Specifies the log file buffer size.
property.default-severity.synopsis=Specifies the default severity levels for the logger.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.all.synopsis=Messages of all severity levels are logged.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.debug.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for messages that provide debugging information triggered during processing.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.fatal-error.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for messages that provide information about fatal errors which may force the server to shut down or operate in a significantly degraded state.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.info.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for messages that provide information about significant events within the server that are not warnings or errors.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.mild-error.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for messages that provide information about mild (recoverable) errors encountered during processing.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.mild-warning.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for messages that provide information about mild warnings triggered during processing.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.none.synopsis=No messages of any severity are logged by default. This value is intended to be used in conjunction with the override-severity property to define an error logger that will publish no error message beside the errors of a given category.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.notice.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for the most important informational messages (i.e., information that should almost always be logged but is not associated with a warning or error condition).
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.severe-error.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for messages that provide information about severe errors encountered during processing.
property.default-severity.syntax.enumeration.value.severe-warning.synopsis=The error log severity that is used for messages that provide information about severe warnings triggered during processing.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the File Based Error Log Publisher is enabled for use.
property.java-class.synopsis=The fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the File Based Error Log Publisher implementation.
property.log-file.synopsis=The file name to use for the log files generated by the File Based Error Log Publisher .
property.log-file.description=The path to the file is relative to the server root.
property.log-file-permissions.synopsis=The UNIX permissions of the log files created by this File Based Error Log Publisher .
property.log-file-permissions.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A valid UNIX mode string. The mode string must contain three digits between zero and seven.
property.override-severity.synopsis=Specifies the override severity levels for the logger based on the category of the messages.
property.override-severity.description=Each override severity level should include the category and the severity levels to log for that category, for example, core=mild-error,info,mild-warning. Valid categories are: core, extensions, protocol, config, log, util, schema, plugin, jeb, backend, tools, task, access-control, admin, sync, version, quicksetup, admin-tool, dsconfig, user-defined. Valid severities are: all, fatal-error, info, mild-error, mild-warning, notice, severe-error, severe-warning, debug.
property.override-severity.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=All messages with the default severity levels are logged.
property.override-severity.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A string in the form category=severity1,severity2...
property.queue-size.synopsis=The maximum number of log records that can be stored in the asynchronous queue.
property.retention-policy.synopsis=The retention policy to use for the File Based Error Log Publisher .
property.retention-policy.description=When multiple policies are used, log files will be cleaned when any of the policy's conditions are met.
property.retention-policy.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=No retention policy is used and log files will never be cleaned.
property.rotation-policy.synopsis=The rotation policy to use for the File Based Error Log Publisher .
property.rotation-policy.description=When multiple policies are used, rotation will occur if any policy's conditions are met.
property.rotation-policy.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=No rotation policy is used and log rotation will not occur.
property.time-interval.synopsis=Specifies the interval at which to check whether the log files need to be rotated.

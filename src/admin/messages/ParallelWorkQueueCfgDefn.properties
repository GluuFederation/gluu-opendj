synopsis=The Parallel Work Queue is a type of work queue that uses a number of worker threads that watch a queue and pick up an operation to process whenever one becomes available.
description=The parallel work queue is a FIFO queue serviced by a fixed number of worker threads. This fixed number of threads can be changed on the fly, with the change taking effect as soon as it is made. This work queue implementation is unbound ie it does not block after reaching certain queue size and as such should only be used on a very well tuned server configuration to avoid potential out of memory errors.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the Parallel Work Queue implementation.
property.num-worker-threads.synopsis=Specifies the number of worker threads to be used for processing operations placed in the queue.
property.num-worker-threads.description=If the value is increased, the additional worker threads are created immediately. If the value is reduced, the appropriate number of threads are destroyed as operations complete processing.
property.num-worker-threads.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Let the server decide.

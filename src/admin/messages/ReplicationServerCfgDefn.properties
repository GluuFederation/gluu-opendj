synopsis=Replication Servers publish updates to Directory Servers within a Replication Domain.
property.assured-timeout.synopsis=The timeout value when waiting for assured mode acknowledgments.
property.assured-timeout.description=Defines the number of milliseconds that the replication server will wait for assured acknowledgments (in either Safe Data or Safe Read assured sub modes) before forgetting them and answer to the entity that sent an update and is waiting for acknowledgment.
property.degraded-status-threshold.synopsis=The number of pending changes as threshold value for putting a directory server in degraded status.
property.degraded-status-threshold.description=This value represents a number of pending changes a replication server has in queue for sending to a directory server. Once this value is crossed, the matching directory server goes in degraded status. When number of pending changes goes back under this value, the directory server is put back in normal status. 0 means status analyzer is disabled and directory servers are never put in degraded status.
property.group-id.synopsis=The group id for the replication server.
property.group-id.description=This value defines the group id of the replication server. The replication system of a LDAP server uses the group id of the replicated domain and tries to connect, if possible, to a replication with the same group id.
property.monitoring-period.synopsis=The period between sending of monitoring messages.
property.monitoring-period.description=Defines the duration that the replication server will wait before sending new monitoring messages to its peers (replication servers and directory servers). Larger values increase the length of time it takes for a directory server to detect and switch to a more suitable replication server, whereas smaller values increase the amount of background network traffic.
property.queue-size.synopsis=Specifies the number of changes that are kept in memory for each directory server in the Replication Domain.
property.replication-db-directory.synopsis=The path where the Replication Server stores all persistent information.
property.replication-port.synopsis=The port on which this Replication Server waits for connections from other Replication Servers or Directory Servers.
property.replication-purge-delay.synopsis=The time (in seconds) after which the Replication Server erases all persistent information.
property.replication-server.synopsis=Specifies the addresses of other Replication Servers to which this Replication Server tries to connect at startup time.
property.replication-server.description=Addresses must be specified using the syntax: hostname:port
property.replication-server.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A host name followed by a ":" and a port number.
property.replication-server-id.synopsis=Specifies a unique identifier for the Replication Server.
property.replication-server-id.description=Each Replication Server must have a different server ID.
property.weight.synopsis=The weight of the replication server.
property.weight.description=The weight affected to the replication server. Each replication server of the topology has a weight. When combined together, the weights of the replication servers of a same group can be translated to a percentage that determines the quantity of directory servers of the topology that should be connected to a replication server. For instance imagine a topology with 3 replication servers (with the same group id) with the following weights: RS1=1, RS2=1, RS3=2. This means that RS1 should have 25% of the directory servers connected in the topology, RS2 25%, and RS3 50%. This may be useful if the replication servers of the topology have a different power and one wants to spread the load between the replication servers according to their power.
property.window-size.synopsis=Specifies the window size that the Replication Server uses when communicating with other Replication Servers.
property.window-size.description=This option may be deprecated and removed in future releases.

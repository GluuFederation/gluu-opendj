user-friendly-plural-name=File Based HTTP Access Log Publishers
synopsis=File Based HTTP Access Log Publishers publish HTTP access messages to the file system.
property.append.synopsis=Specifies whether to append to existing log files.
property.asynchronous.synopsis=Indicates whether the File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher will publish records asynchronously.
property.auto-flush.synopsis=Specifies whether to flush the writer after every log record.
property.auto-flush.description=If the asynchronous writes option is used, the writer is flushed after all the log records in the queue are written.
property.buffer-size.synopsis=Specifies the log file buffer size.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher is enabled for use.
property.java-class.synopsis=The fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher implementation.
property.log-file.synopsis=The file name to use for the log files generated by the File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher. The path to the file is relative to the server root.
property.log-file.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A path to an existing file that is readable by the server.
property.log-file-permissions.synopsis=The UNIX permissions of the log files created by this File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher.
property.log-file-permissions.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A valid UNIX mode string. The mode string must contain three digits between zero and seven.
property.log-format.synopsis=Specifies how log records should be formatted and written to the HTTP access log.
property.log-format.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A space separated list of fields describing the extended log format to be used for logging HTTP accesses. Available values are listed on the W3C working draft http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html and Microsoft website http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/676400bc-8969-4aa7-851a-9319490a9bbb.mspx?mfr=true OpenDJ supports the following standard fields: "c-ip", "c-port", "cs-host", "cs-method", "cs-uri-query", "cs(User-Agent)", "cs-username", "cs-version", "s-computername", "s-ip", "s-port", "sc-status". OpenDJ supports the following application specific field extensions: "x-connection-id" displays the internal connection ID assigned to the HTTP client connection, "x-datetime" displays the completion date and time for the logged HTTP request and its ouput is controlled by the "ds-cfg-log-record-time-format" property, "x-etime" displays the total execution time for the logged HTTP request.
property.log-record-time-format.synopsis=Specifies the format string that is used to generate log record timestamps.
property.log-record-time-format.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=Any valid format string that can be used with the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class.
property.queue-size.synopsis=The maximum number of log records that can be stored in the asynchronous queue.
property.queue-size.description=Setting the queue size to zero activates parallel log writer implementation which has no queue size limit and as such the parallel log writer should only be used on a very well tuned server configuration to avoid potential out of memory errors.
property.queue-size.requires-admin-action.synopsis=The File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher must be restarted if this property is changed and the asynchronous property is set to true.
property.retention-policy.synopsis=The retention policy to use for the File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher .
property.retention-policy.description=When multiple policies are used, log files are cleaned when any of the policy's conditions are met.
property.retention-policy.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=No retention policy is used and log files are never cleaned.
property.rotation-policy.synopsis=The rotation policy to use for the File Based HTTP Access Log Publisher .
property.rotation-policy.description=When multiple policies are used, rotation will occur if any policy's conditions are met.
property.rotation-policy.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=No rotation policy is used and log rotation will not occur.
property.time-interval.synopsis=Specifies the interval at which to check whether the log files need to be rotated.

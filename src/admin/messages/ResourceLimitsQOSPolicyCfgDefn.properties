user-friendly-plural-name=Resource Limits QOS Policies
synopsis=The Resource Limits QOS Policy are used to define resource limits enforced by the server.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the Resource Limits QOS Policy implementation.
property.max-concurrent-ops-per-connection.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations per client connection.
property.max-concurrent-ops-per-connection.description=A value of 0 means that no limit is enforced.
property.max-connections.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of concurrent client connections to the server.
property.max-connections.description=A value of 0 means that no limit is enforced.
property.max-connections-from-same-ip.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of client connections from the same source address.
property.max-connections-from-same-ip.description=A value of 0 means that no limit is enforced.
property.max-ops-interval.synopsis=Specifies the interval during which the number of operations is limited.
property.max-ops-interval.description=When the maximum number of operations per interval is reached, all subsequent operations on the same network group are refused until the end of the time interval. This parameter allows to limit the throughput on the network group.
property.max-ops-per-connection.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of operations per client connection.
property.max-ops-per-connection.description=A value of 0 means that no limit is enforced.
property.max-ops-per-interval.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of operations that can take place on the same network group during the specified interval.
property.max-ops-per-interval.description=When the maximum number of operations per interval is reached, all subsequent operations on the same network group are refused until the end of the time interval. This parameter allows to limit the throughput on the network group. A value of 0 indicates that no limit is enforced.
property.min-substring-length.synopsis=Specifies the minimum length for a search filter substring.
property.min-substring-length.description=Search operations with short search filter substring are likely to match a high number of entries and might degrade performance overall. A value of 0 indicates that no limit is enforced.
property.size-limit.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of entries that can be returned to the client during a single search operation.
property.size-limit.description=A value of 0 indicates that no size limit is enforced. Note that this is the default for the server, but it may be overridden on a per-user basis using the ds-rlim-size-limit operational attribute.
property.time-limit.synopsis=Specifies the maximum length of time that should be spent processing a search operation.
property.time-limit.description=A value of 0 seconds indicates that no time limit is enforced. Note that this is the default for the server, but it may be overridden on a per-user basis using the ds-rlim-time-limit operational attribute.

user-friendly-plural-name=JMX Connection Handlers
synopsis=The JMX Connection Handler is used to interact with clients using the Java Management Extensions (JMX) protocol.
constraint.1.synopsis=A Key Manager Provider must be specified when this JMX Connection Handler is enabled and it is configured to use SSL.
property.allowed-client.synopsis=Specifies a set of host names or address masks that determine the clients that are allowed to establish connections to this JMX Connection Handler.
property.allowed-client.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask.
property.allowed-client.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=All clients with addresses that do not match an address on the deny list are allowed. If there is no deny list, then all clients are allowed.
property.allowed-client.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately and do not interfere with connections that may have already been established.
property.denied-client.synopsis=Specifies a set of host names or address masks that determine the clients that are not allowed to establish connections to this JMX Connection Handler.
property.denied-client.description=Valid values include a host name, a fully qualified domain name, a domain name, an IP address, or a subnetwork with subnetwork mask. If both allowed and denied client masks are defined and a client connection matches one or more masks in both lists, then the connection is denied. If only a denied list is specified, then any client not matching a mask in that list is allowed.
property.denied-client.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=If an allow list is specified, then only clients with addresses on the allow list are allowed. Otherwise, all clients are allowed.
property.denied-client.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately and do not interfere with connections that may have already been established.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the JMX Connection Handler is enabled.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the JMX Connection Handler implementation.
property.key-manager-provider.synopsis=Specifies the name of the key manager that should be used with this JMX Connection Handler .
property.key-manager-provider.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately, but only for subsequent attempts to access the key manager provider for associated client connections.
property.key-manager-provider.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced key manager provider must be enabled when the JMX Connection Handler is enabled and configured to use SSL.
property.listen-address.synopsis=Specifies the address or set of addresses on which this JMX Connection Handler should listen for connections from SNMP clients.
property.listen-address.description=Multiple addresses may be provided as separate values for this attribute. If no values are provided, then the JMX Connection Handler listens on all interfaces.
property.listen-port.synopsis=Specifies the port number on which the JMX Connection Handler will listen for connections from clients.
property.listen-port.description=Only a single port number may be provided.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.synopsis=Specifies the nickname (also called the alias) of the certificate that the JMX Connection Handler should use when performing SSL communication.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.description=This is only applicable when the JMX Connection Handler is configured to use SSL.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Let the server decide.
property.use-ssl.synopsis=Indicates whether the JMX Connection Handler should use SSL.
property.use-ssl.description=If enabled, the JMX Connection Handler will use SSL to encrypt communication with the clients.

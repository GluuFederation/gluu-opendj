synopsis=The Traditional Work Queue is a type of work queue that uses a number of worker threads that watch a queue and pick up an operation to process whenever one becomes available.
description=The traditional work queue is a FIFO queue serviced by a fixed number of worker threads. This fixed number of threads can be changed on the fly, with the change taking effect as soon as it is made. You can limit the size of the work queue to a specified number of operations. When this many operations are in the queue, waiting to be picked up by threads, any new requests are rejected with an error message.

property.max-work-queue-capacity.synopsis=Specifies the maximum number of queued operations that can be in the work queue at any given time.
property.max-work-queue-capacity.description=If the work queue is already full and additional requests are received by the server, the requests are rejected. A value of zero indicates that there is no limit to the size of the queue.
property.max-work-queue-capacity.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=The work queue does not impose any limit on the number of operations that can be enqueued at any one time.
property.num-worker-threads.synopsis=Specifies the number of worker threads to be used for processing operations placed in the queue.

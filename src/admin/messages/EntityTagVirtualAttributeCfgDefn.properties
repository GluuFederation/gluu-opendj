user-friendly-name=Entity Tag Virtual Attribute
user-friendly-plural-name=Entity Tag Virtual Attributes
synopsis=The Entity Tag Virtual Attribute ensures that all entries contain an "entity tag" or "Etag" as defined in section 3.11 of RFC 2616.
description=The entity tag may be used by clients, in conjunction with the assertion control, for optimistic concurrency control, as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of an entry from conflicting with each other.
property.attribute-type.synopsis=Specifies the attribute type for the attribute whose values are to be dynamically assigned by the virtual attribute.
property.base-dn.synopsis=Specifies the base DNs for the branches containing entries that are eligible to use this virtual attribute.
property.base-dn.description=If no values are given, then the server generates virtual attributes anywhere in the server.
property.base-dn.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=The location of the entry in the server is not taken into account when determining whether an entry is eligible to use this virtual attribute.
property.checksum-algorithm.synopsis=The algorithm which should be used for calculating the entity tag checksum value.
property.checksum-algorithm.syntax.enumeration.value.adler-32.synopsis=The Adler-32 checksum algorithm which is almost as reliable as a CRC-32 but can be computed much faster.
property.checksum-algorithm.syntax.enumeration.value.crc-32.synopsis=The CRC-32 checksum algorithm.
property.conflict-behavior.synopsis=Specifies the behavior that the server is to exhibit for entries that already contain one or more real values for the associated attribute.
property.conflict-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.merge-real-and-virtual.synopsis=Indicates that the virtual attribute provider is to preserve any real values contained in the entry and merge them with the set of generated virtual values so that both the real and virtual values are used.
property.conflict-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.real-overrides-virtual.synopsis=Indicates that any real values contained in the entry are preserved and used, and virtual values are not generated.
property.conflict-behavior.syntax.enumeration.value.virtual-overrides-real.synopsis=Indicates that the virtual attribute provider suppresses any real values contained in the entry and generates virtual values and uses them.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the Entity Tag Virtual Attribute is enabled for use.
property.excluded-attribute.synopsis=The list of attributes which should be ignored when calculating the entity tag checksum value.
property.excluded-attribute.description=Certain attributes like "ds-sync-hist" may vary between replicas due to different purging schedules and should not be included in the checksum.
property.filter.synopsis=Specifies the search filters to be applied against entries to determine if the virtual attribute is to be generated for those entries.
property.filter.description=If no values are given, then any entry is eligible to have the value generated. If one or more filters are specified, then only entries that match at least one of those filters are allowed to have the virtual attribute.
property.filter.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=Any valid search filter string.
property.group-dn.synopsis=Specifies the DNs of the groups whose members can be eligible to use this virtual attribute.
property.group-dn.description=If no values are given, then group membership is not taken into account when generating the virtual attribute. If one or more group DNs are specified, then only members of those groups are allowed to have the virtual attribute.
property.group-dn.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Group membership is not taken into account when determining whether an entry is eligible to use this virtual attribute.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the virtual attribute provider class that generates the attribute values.
property.scope.synopsis=Specifies the LDAP scope associated with base DNs for entries that are eligible to use this virtual attribute.
property.scope.syntax.enumeration.value.base-object.synopsis=Search the base object only.
property.scope.syntax.enumeration.value.single-level.synopsis=Search the immediate children of the base object but do not include any of their descendants or the base object itself.
property.scope.syntax.enumeration.value.subordinate-subtree.synopsis=Search the entire subtree below the base object but do not include the base object itself.
property.scope.syntax.enumeration.value.whole-subtree.synopsis=Search the base object and the entire subtree below the base object.

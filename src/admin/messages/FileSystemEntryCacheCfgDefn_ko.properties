synopsis=The File System Entry Cache is an entry cache implementation which uses a JE database to keep track of the entries.
description=For best performance, the JE database should reside in a memory based file system although any file system will do for this cache to function. Entries are maintained either by FIFO (default) or LRU-based (configurable) list implementation. Cache sizing is based on the size of free space available in the file system, such that if enough memory is free, then adding an entry to the cache will not require purging. If more than the specified size of the file system available space is already consumed, then one or more entries need to be removed in order to make room for a new entry. It is also possible to configure a maximum number of entries for the cache. If this is specified, then the number of entries are not allowed to exceed this value, but it may not be possible to hold this many entries if the available memory fills up first. Other configurable parameters for this cache include the maximum length of time to block while waiting to acquire a lock, and a set of filters that may be used to define criteria for determining which entries are stored in the cache. If a set of filters are provided then an entry must match at least one of them in order to be stored in the cache. JE environment cache size can also be configured either as a percentage of the free memory available in the JVM, or as an absolute size in bytes. This cache has a persistence property which, if enabled, allows for the contents of the cache to persist across server or cache restarts.
property.cache-directory.synopsis=Specifies the directory in which the JE environment should store the cache.
property.cache-level.synopsis=Specifies the cache level in the cache order if more than one instance of the cache is configured.
property.cache-type.synopsis=Specifies the policy which should be used for purging entries from the cache.
property.cache-type.syntax.enumeration.value.fifo.synopsis=FIFO based entry cache.
property.cache-type.syntax.enumeration.value.lru.synopsis=LRU based entry cache.
property.compact-encoding.synopsis=Indicates whether the cache should use a compact form when encoding cache entries by compressing the attribute descriptions and object class sets.
property.compact-encoding.description=Note that compression does not preserve user-supplied capitalization in the object class and attribute type names.
property.compact-encoding.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changing this property only affects the encoding of the cache entries put in the cache after the change is made. It will not be retroactively applied to existing cache entries.
property.db-cache-percent.synopsis=Specifies the maximum memory usage for the internal JE cache as a percentage of the total JVM memory.
property.db-cache-size.synopsis=Specifies the maximum JVM memory usage in bytes for the internal JE cache.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the File System Entry Cache is enabled.
property.exclude-filter.synopsis=The set of filters that define the entries that should be excluded from the cache.
property.include-filter.synopsis=The set of filters that define the entries that should be included in the cache.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the File System Entry Cache implementation.
property.je-property.synopsis=Specifies the environment properties for the Berkeley DB Java Edition database providing the backend for this entry cache.
property.je-property.description=Any Berkeley DB Java Edition property can be specified using the following form: property-name=property-value. Refer to the OpenDJ documentation for further information on related properties, their implications and range values. The definitive identification of all the property parameters available in the example.properties file in the Berkeley DB Java Edition distribution.
property.lock-timeout.synopsis=The length of time to wait while attempting to acquire a read or write lock.
property.max-entries.synopsis=The maximum number of entries allowed in the cache.
property.max-memory-size.synopsis=The maximum size of the entry cache in bytes.
property.persistent-cache.synopsis=Specifies whether the cache should persist across restarts.

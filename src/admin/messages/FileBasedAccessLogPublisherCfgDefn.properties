user-friendly-plural-name=File Based Access Log Publishers
synopsis=File Based Access Log Publishers publish access messages to the file system.
property.append.synopsis=Specifies whether to append to existing log files.
property.asynchronous.synopsis=Indicates whether the File Based Access Log Publisher will publish records asynchronously.
property.auto-flush.synopsis=Specifies whether to flush the writer after every log record.
property.auto-flush.description=If the asynchronous writes option is used, the writer is flushed after all the log records in the queue are written.
property.buffer-size.synopsis=Specifies the log file buffer size.
property.enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the File Based Access Log Publisher is enabled for use.
property.filtering-policy.synopsis=Specifies how filtering criteria should be applied to log records.
property.filtering-policy.syntax.enumeration.value.exclusive.synopsis=Records must not match any of the filtering criteria in order to be logged.
property.filtering-policy.syntax.enumeration.value.inclusive.synopsis=Records must match at least one of the filtering criteria in order to be logged.
property.filtering-policy.syntax.enumeration.value.no-filtering.synopsis=No filtering will be performed, and all records will be logged.
property.java-class.synopsis=The fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the File Based Access Log Publisher implementation.
property.log-control-oids.synopsis=Specifies whether control OIDs will be included in operation log records.
property.log-file.synopsis=The file name to use for the log files generated by the File Based Access Log Publisher. The path to the file is relative to the server root.
property.log-file.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A path to an existing file that is readable by the server.
property.log-file-permissions.synopsis=The UNIX permissions of the log files created by this File Based Access Log Publisher.
property.log-file-permissions.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A valid UNIX mode string. The mode string must contain three digits between zero and seven.
property.log-format.synopsis=Specifies how log records should be formatted and written to the access log.
property.log-format.syntax.enumeration.value.combined.synopsis=Combine log records for operation requests and responses into a single record. This format should be used when log records are to be filtered based on response criteria (e.g. result code).
property.log-format.syntax.enumeration.value.multi-line.synopsis=Outputs separate log records for operation requests and responses.
property.log-record-time-format.synopsis=Specifies the format string that is used to generate log record timestamps.
property.log-record-time-format.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=Any valid format string that can be used with the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class.
property.queue-size.synopsis=The maximum number of log records that can be stored in the asynchronous queue.
property.queue-size.description=Setting the queue size to zero activates parallel log writer implementation which has no queue size limit and as such the parallel log writer should only be used on a very well tuned server configuration to avoid potential out of memory errors.
property.queue-size.requires-admin-action.synopsis=The File Based Access Log Publisher must be restarted if this property is changed and the asynchronous property is set to true.
property.retention-policy.synopsis=The retention policy to use for the File Based Access Log Publisher .
property.retention-policy.description=When multiple policies are used, log files are cleaned when any of the policy's conditions are met.
property.retention-policy.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=No retention policy is used and log files are never cleaned.
property.rotation-policy.synopsis=The rotation policy to use for the File Based Access Log Publisher .
property.rotation-policy.description=When multiple policies are used, rotation will occur if any policy's conditions are met.
property.rotation-policy.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=No rotation policy is used and log rotation will not occur.
property.suppress-internal-operations.synopsis=Indicates whether internal operations (for example, operations that are initiated by plugins) should be logged along with the operations that are requested by users.
property.suppress-synchronization-operations.synopsis=Indicates whether access messages that are generated by synchronization operations should be suppressed.
property.time-interval.synopsis=Specifies the interval at which to check whether the log files need to be rotated.
relation.access-log-filtering-criteria.user-friendly-name=Access Log Filtering Criteria
relation.access-log-filtering-criteria.user-friendly-plural-name=Access Log Filtering Criteria
relation.access-log-filtering-criteria.synopsis=The set of criteria which will be used to filter log records.

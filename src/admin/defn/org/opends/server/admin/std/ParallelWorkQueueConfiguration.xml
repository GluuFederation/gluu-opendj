  <adm:synopsis>
    The
    <adm:user-friendly-name />
    is a type of work queue that uses a number of worker threads that
    watch a queue and pick up an operation to process whenever one
    becomes available.
  </adm:synopsis>
  <adm:description>
    The parallel work queue is a FIFO queue serviced by a fixed
    number of worker threads. This fixed number of threads can be
    changed on the fly, with the change taking effect as soon as
    it is made. This work queue implementation is unbound ie it
    does not block after reaching certain queue size and as such
    should only be used on a very well tuned server configuration
    to avoid potential out of memory errors.

      If the value is increased,
      the additional worker threads are created immediately. If the
      value is reduced, the appropriate number of threads are destroyed
      as operations complete processing.

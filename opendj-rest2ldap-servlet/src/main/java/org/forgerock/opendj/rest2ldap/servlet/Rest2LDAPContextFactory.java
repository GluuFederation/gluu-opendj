 * This class provides integration between Rest2LDAP HTTP Servlets and the
 * {@link Rest2LDAPAuthnFilter}, by providing a mechanism allowing the filter to
 * pass a pre-authenticated LDAP connection through to the underlying Rest2LDAP
 * implementation for use when performing subsequent LDAP operations. The
 * following code illustrates how an authentication Servlet filter can populate
 * the attributes:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
 *     // Authenticate the user.
 *     String username = getUserName(request);
 *     String password = getPassword(request);
 *     final Connection connection = getLDAPConnection();
 *
 *     // Publish the authenticated connection.
 *     try {
 *         connection.bind(username, password.toCharArray());
 *         request.setAttribute(ATTRIBUTE_AUTHN_CONNECTION, connection);
 *     } catch (LdapException e) {
 *         // Fail the HTTP request.
 *         response.setStatus(...);
 *         return;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Invoke the rest of the filter chain and then release the LDAP connection once
 *     // processing has completed. Note that this assumes that the filter chain is
 *     // processes requests synchronous.
 *     try {
 *         chain.doFilter(request, response);
 *     } finally {
 *         connection.close();
 *     }

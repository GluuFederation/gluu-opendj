/**
 * A fail-over load balancing algorithm provides fault tolerance across multiple
 * underlying connection factories.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is typically used for load-balancing <i>between</i> data
 * centers, where there is preference to always forward connection requests to
 * the <i>closest available</i> data center. This algorithm contrasts with the
 * {@link RoundRobinLoadBalancingAlgorithm} which is used for load-balancing
 * <i>within</i> a data center.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm selects connection factories based on the order in which they
 * were provided during construction. More specifically, an attempt to obtain a
 * connection factory will always return the <i>first operational</i> connection
 * factory in the list. Applications should, therefore, organize the connection
 * factories such that the <i>preferred</i> (usually the closest) connection
 * factories appear before those which are less preferred.
 * <p>
 * If a problem occurs that temporarily prevents connections from being obtained
 * for one of the connection factories, then this algorithm automatically
 * "fails over" to the next operational connection factory in the list. If none
 * of the connection factories are operational then a
 * {@code ConnectionException} is returned to the client.
 * <p>
 * The implementation periodically attempts to connect to failed connection
 * factories in order to determine if they have become available again.
 *

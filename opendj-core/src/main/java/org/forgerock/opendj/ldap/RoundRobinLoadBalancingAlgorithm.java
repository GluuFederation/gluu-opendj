/**
 * A round robin load balancing algorithm distributes connection requests across
 * a list of connection factories one at a time. When the end of the list is
 * reached, the algorithm starts again from the beginning.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is typically used for load-balancing <i>within</i> data
 * centers, where load must be distributed equally across multiple data sources.
 * This algorithm contrasts with the {@link FailoverLoadBalancingAlgorithm}
 * which is used for load-balancing <i>between</i> data centers.
 * <p>
 * If a problem occurs that temporarily prevents connections from being obtained
 * for one of the connection factories, then this algorithm automatically
 * "fails over" to the next operational connection factory in the list. If none
 * of the connection factories are operational then a
 * {@code ConnectionException} is returned to the client.
 * <p>
 * The implementation periodically attempts to connect to failed connection
 * factories in order to determine if they have become available again.

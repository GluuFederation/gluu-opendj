This folder contains source code for various experimental extensions,
which are not fit for production use. Some are not actively maintained,
and may not even compile.

To create a new experimental extension use the provided example-plugin
as a template. Unzip it, rename the extension's directory to something
more appropriate and configure the Ant build.xml file contained within
as directed.

Note that any I18N properties should be contained in a file called
${extension.name}.properties.
